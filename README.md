# XOR-neural-network
A simple artificial neural network to demonstrate fundamental concepts of machine learning.
This program illustrates how to create a neural network from scratch only making use of Numpy.
No hyperparameter tuning has been done on this network, the purpose of the network is to illustrate how to implement some of the fundemantal concepts of machine learing, such as backpropagation, in Python.
I have written an article explaining the project and all of the mathematics behind the concepts implemented. To read the more about how neural networks function and to understand the mathematics behind them go to my website: https://machinelearningjourney.com/
